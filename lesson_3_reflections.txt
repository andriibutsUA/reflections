When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working in a team or working on an open-source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might happen to have files in the working directory that have not been commited yet. Auto pull will overwrite them.
