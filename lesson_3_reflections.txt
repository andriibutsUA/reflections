When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working in a team or working on an open-source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might happen to have files in the working directory that have not been commited yet. Auto pull will overwrite them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of other repositories on github and are hosted there automatically. A clone of a repository can be created both on github and locally. Branch is a part of a repository with new features in development.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to workon a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave. I can do this even if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would suggest to use google docs or dropbox.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you are working on your own it is easier to work on a single branch. When working in a team, branches help to keep track of the progress and the changes.
