When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working in a team or working on an open-source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might happen to have files in the working directory that have not been commited yet. Auto pull will overwrite them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of other repositories on github and are hosted there automatically. A clone of a repository can be created both on github and locally. Branch is a part of a repository with new features in development.
